Why use Gather for an virtual poster session?
It’s fun! Everyone will have an avatar they can customise.
Gather is suitable for a virtual poster session because we can recreate a live poster space. We can set up private spaces for presenters to communicate with other delegates and discuss their posters. 

How Do People Communicate on Gather?
If you have your mic and camera enabled, your video and audio will be shared with people nearby automatically.

How to Organise Your Event

Billing and Invoice
Getting an invoice and paying for the correct amount of people and time was the most daunting part of organising the poster session for the conference. It was really important the space could host the maximum amount of delegates, but the payment plans on the Gather website do not make it immediately clear how to arrange for a one-off multiday event. 
Essentially our spaces are always available for free for up to 25 people. If we want to host most people – in our case, we needed to host 150 delegates – we need to rent more server space.

Email draft for attendees/delegates:
Prior to the virtual poster sessions I gave a two minute presentation on how to use Gather to encourage delegates to join in. This was particularly important to us as we had delegates who were presenting their posters exclusively online, and we wanted them to have the opportunity to engage with others.
