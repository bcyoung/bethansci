I recently organised an hosted an online virtual poster session for a international hybrid [conference](https://meetings.embo.org/event/21-codon) using Gather. 

During this experience I found there were plenty of video tutorials for attendees of such events but not much helpful content on how to organise and host them.

Below I share my experience and some hints and tips for organisers of Gather conference sessions. 

You can also view the video tutorial for this post [here]().

# What is Gather?
[Gather.town](https://www.gather.town/) is an online platform used for meetings, with customisable characters people can use to navigate bespoke spaces. 

## Why use Gather for an virtual poster session?

It’s fun! Everyone will have an avatar they can customise and use to interact with others.

Gather is suitable for a virtual poster session because we can recreate a live poster space, and organise posters in rooms according to ID. 

We can also set up private spaces for presenters to communicate with other delegates and discuss their posters. 

## How Do People Communicate on Gather?

If you have your mic and camera enabled, your video and audio will be **shared with people nearby automatically**.

You will be able to communicate with them in the same way you would if your were in a video call on other platforms.

There are also private spaces which we can set up to limit connections to people in the private space. 

We will use private spaces in front on posters to allow presenters to discuss their posters to a private audience.

### Uploading your poster

Posters need to be either .jpeg or .png. Gather has a list of specifications on their help page below, but we kept our instructions simple and asked our presenters to provide us with a .png file with acceptable resolution. 

We didn't have any problems uploading these into the Poster Sets.

### Poster previews

Smaller images of posters can be saved as poster previews, which appear on the bottom of the screen when your avatar walks past a Poster.

We decided instead to use a .png file containing the presenter's name and poster title, and this worked well.

## Billing and Invoice

Getting an invoice and paying for the correct amount of people and time was the most daunting part of organising the poster session for the conference. 

It was really important the space could host the maximum amount of delegates, but the payment plans on the Gather website do not make it immediately clear how to arrange for a one-off multiday event. 

Our spaces are always available for free for up to 25 people. If we want to host most people – in our case, we needed to host 150 delegates – we need to rent more server space. 

## Giving instructions to your delegates


The best way to introduce your delegates and poster presenters is to provide them with a handout e.g. pdf with clear instructions, and screen-capture images so they know what to expect.

*Email draft for attendees/delegates:*

Prior to the virtual poster sessions I gave a two minute presentation on how to use Gather to encourage delegates to join in. This was particularly important to us as we had delegates who were presenting their posters exclusively online, and we wanted them to have the opportunity to engage with others.  

##Things to Remember

Gather works best on Google Chrome.

At present, April 2023, the mobile version of Gather is not well optimised. However, if your conference is hybrid, you may want to use a **QR code** which in-person delegates can access using their phones. They will be given the option to email themselves the link to the Gather space. 

I hope you have found this user's guide helpful. 

Best of luck with your poster session!
